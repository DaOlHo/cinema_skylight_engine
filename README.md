# Cinema Skylight Engine

A Rust-based game engine that intends to allow a simple but highley customizable way to create visual-novels similar to Film-Window system present in _The Silver Case_ and _The 25th Ward: The Silver Case_ by Grasshopper Manuacture. Also aims to expand on ideas present in the Film-Window system.

## Why Rust?

The decision to use Rust was to allow for a more ergonomic and safe experience for those developing games with the engine, without sacrificing speed or the ability to create extremely advanced games if one desires. This project uses safe abstractions over OpenGL to allow for as much native Rust when creating a game as possible.

## Current state

The current state of the engine is highly WIP, focused on getting a working prototype finished quickly using OpenGL. Later, support for other graphics libraries and significant customization is intended.
